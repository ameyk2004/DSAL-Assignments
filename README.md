## Problem Statements

<h3 id="assn1">Assignment 1 - Binary Tree</h3>
<pre>
Beginning with an empty binary tree, construct binary tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations on it-
• Perform non-recursive inorder traversal, recursive postorder
• Level wise printing
• Display and count leaf nodes
• Display and count internal nodes
                                        OR
Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression (e.g. +--a*bc/def) and perform following operations on it
1) traverse it using non recursive post order traversal
2) Count and Display operands in given expression
3) Count and display operators in given expression
</pre>

<h3 id="assn2">Assignment 2 - Binary Search Tree</h3>
<pre>
Construct binary search tree. Provide facility for adding new entries, deleting any element. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending order using non- recursive traversal. Search an element present in a tree and display number of comparisons required to search.
</pre>
