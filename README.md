## Problem Statements

<h3 id="assn1">Assignment 1 - Binary Tree</h3>
<pre>
Beginning with an empty binary tree, construct binary tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations on it-
• Perform non-recursive inorder traversal, recursive postorder
• Level wise printing
• Display and count leaf nodes
• Display and count internal nodes
                                        OR
Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression (e.g. +--a*bc/def) and perform following operations on it
1) traverse it using non recursive post order traversal
2) Count and Display operands in given expression
3) Count and display operators in given expression
</pre>

<h3 id="assn2">Assignment 2 - Binary Search Tree</h3>
<pre>
Construct binary search tree. Provide facility for adding new entries, deleting any element. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending order using non- recursive traversal. Search an element present in a tree and display number of comparisons required to search.
</pre>

<h3 id="assn3">Assignment 3 - Threaded Binary Search Tree</h3>
<pre>
Construct In ordered Threaded binary Search Tree. Perform its inorder traversal. Display Smallest and largest value in it. Display lbit and rbit of each node.

Create an inordered threaded binary search tree for integer. Perform inorder traversal,
and deletion of a node.
Note: Display lbit, rbit for every node

Create an inordered threaded binary search tree for integer value. Perform preorder traversals and deletion of a node.
Note: Display lbit, rbit for every node
</pre>

<h3 id="assn4">Assignment 4 - Telephone Book Hashing</h3>
<pre>
Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers (Note: Use linear probing with replacement and without replacement). Perform following operations
1) Insert
2) Display
3) Search (number of comparisons required to search)
Use Hash function as H(x) = (3*x + 5)%10
</pre>

<h3 id="assn5">Assignment 5 - Open Hashing</h3>
<pre>
Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open hashing technique: separate 
chaining using linked list Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys 
must be comparable, and Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert (key, value), 
Find(key), Delete(key). 

Use hash function as H(x) = (3x+5) % 10
