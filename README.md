<h3>Assignment 1 - Binary Tree</h3>
<pre>
Beginning with an empty binary tree, construct binary tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations on it-
• Perform non-recursive inorder traversal, recursive postorder
• Level wise printing
• Display and count leaf nodes
• Display and count internal nodes
                                        OR
Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression (e.g. +--a*bc/def) and perform following operations on it
1) traverse it using non recursive post order traversal
2) Count and Display operands in given expression
3) Count and display operators in given expression
